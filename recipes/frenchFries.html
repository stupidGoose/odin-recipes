    </p>

    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
      <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>½ cup water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of
        cold water to prevent them from turning brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175
        degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika,
        and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a
        slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.
      </li>

      <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time.</li>
      <li>
        Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from
        clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about
        7 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
